# magicrecyclingmachine
The goal is to recycle kids art from donors choose into more kids art, by auctioning the art and donating all proceeds back to donors choose.  Our most ambitious hope is that it can be made generic and simple enough to serve as a model for similar systems.

All notes on design and implementation are going in [the wiki](https://github.com/richbodo/magicrecyclingmachine/wiki).  Any notes or docs should be contributed there.
